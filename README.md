# Kaggle-Titanic

My first true introduction to hands-on data science using machine learning. Initial code for the model inspired by the tutorial page here at https://www.kaggle.com/code/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial.

Within the notebook are my attempts at explaining the model/code, in-depth analysis on the data and predictions, as well as looking at ways to tune the model for higher prexision.
